MySpeakingPage helps you quickly create a professional speaking page that will help you get more gigs by showing off your expertise, testimonials, and more.

You can find a **live demo** of MySpeakingPage in action [here](http://www.authormedia.com/myspeakingpage/ "MySpeakingPage Demo").

= Features =

**Customizable "Book To Speak" Button**

Make it easy for event planners to book you with MySpeakingPage' customizable "call to action" button. You pick the text ("Invite Liz to Speak") and where the button goes (www.example.com/form).

**YouTube & Vimeo Integration**

Show off samples of your speaking in style. Don't have a promo video for your speaking yet? No problem. You can easily substitute a photo (an action image of you speaking in front of an audience works best).

**Speakers Bureau Integration**

Do you have an agency who handles your bookings for you? No problem. MySpeakingPage can integrate with your speakers bureau website.

**High Resolution Headshots & Bio**

The two things every event planner asks for you to email them are your photo and your bio. MySpeakingPage puts those often-requested items on a silver platter. No email required. You can even show off high resolution versions of your headshots that may not fit in an email.

**Great Looking Testimonials**

MySpeakingPage makes it easy to add testimonials. It also makes those testimonials look great with optional photos, titles and more.

**All-Around Easy Audio Samples**

Do you have some recordings of talks you would like to share? Just click "add audio sample" and MySpeakingPage will handle the rest for you. MSP creates a special audio player where  your visitors can listen with a click. Easy for you. Easy for your visitors.

**MySpeakingEvents Integration**

If you have MySpeakingEvents installed, you can easily show off both upcoming events and past events right there on your speaking page.

**Mobile Responsive**
MySpeakingPage is 100% mobile responsive.
